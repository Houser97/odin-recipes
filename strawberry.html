        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p> This page will make sure you can cook a mouth-watering dish
                in which chocolate and strawberries play a crucial role 
                in, by all accounts, making this dish an easy one to fall in love.
            </p>
            <p> Paraffin was originally used instead of shortening. Turn the strawberries upside down and insert by the toothpicks into a piece of styrofoam for easy cooling, or simply place them on a sheet of wax paper. 
                White chocolate may be drizzled over the milk chocolate for a fancier look. 
                They are perfect for weddings when decorated with frosting bow ties, bells, butterflies, roses, etc.
