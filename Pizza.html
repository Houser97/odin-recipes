    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 16 ounce ball of pizza dough, 12 to 16 ounces is fine.</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, for rubbing dough.</li>
            <li>1 cup pizza sauce.</li>
            <li>3 ounces thinly sliced mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>5 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese, about 1 and 1/4 cups.</li>
            <li>2.5 ounces pepperoni , about half a 5 oz package.</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons shredded parmesan cheese.</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 550 degrees F, or as high as it will go (at least 475.) Let the stone preheat for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Prepare a work surface.</li>
            <li><stron>Roll out the dough</stron>. Place your ball of pizza dough in the center of your prepared work surface and use your hands to press it down, starting from the center. Keep gently patting out the dough, moving the dough outward from the center.
                Make sure to keep rotating the pin so that you get a roughly circular shape. It doesn't have to be perfect!
            </li>
            <li><strong>Transfer the dough to a square of parchment paper</strong>.
                Make sure you stretch out the dough so that it is about 12 inches.
                Drizzle about a tablespoon of olive oil over the top of your dough. Use your hands or a pastry brush to rub the oil all over the top of the dough, especially the edges of the crust. This layer of oil helps provide a barrier between the toppings and the dough, helping it cook more evenly.
                If you love a thicker crust pizza, let the rolled-out dough rest for 10 minutes. You can skip this rest no problem.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Par bake</strong>. Once the oven is up to temperature, we are going to do a 1 to 2 minute par bake.</li>
            <li><strong>Top your pizza.</strong>. Leave the crust on the peel while you add your toppings.
                Add 1 cup of pizza sauce 
            </li>
            <li>Bake the pizza for about 8-12 minutes. This is going to depend on how hot your oven is, and how thick your pizza is. The edges of the crust should be golden brown, and the cheese should be bubbly and also starting to lightly brown. If you don't have a pizza stone, use a spatula to lift the edge of your pizza to make sure that it is browning all across the center on bottom. If the bottom is still white, you are looking at a doughy pizza. No thanks. Leave it in longer.</li>
            <li>Remove your pizza from the oven using the pizza peel. Slide it directly onto a cooling rack to help keep that bottom crust from getting soggy. Let cool a couple minutes, then transfer to a cutting board. Slice into 8 pieces and devour!</li>
